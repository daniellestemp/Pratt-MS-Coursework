The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic had a sudden, devastating impact on labor markets worldwide: among unionized and non-union sectors in the United States, millions of workers were furloughed or laid off.

Interested in these trends in unionization patterns, I analyzed recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to visualize and better understand three variables associated with organized labor: union membership, union member earnings, and major work stoppages in the U.S. from 2020-2024.
